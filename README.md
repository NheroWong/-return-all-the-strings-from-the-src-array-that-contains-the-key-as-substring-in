Google. The question asked was given below. Just asking Leetcode community the good optimal solution for this.

Suppose you have an array of strings 'src' and a string 'key':

src = {"minecraftgame", "intelligent", "innercrafttalent", "knife", "scissor", "stonecrafter"}
key = "craft"
Now return all the strings from the 'src' array that contains the key as substring in them. For example, for above case, the solution should be:

result = {"minecraftgame", innercrafttalent", "stonecrafter"}
Because all the result starings have key i.e. "craft" in them as substring
